My name is Zai and there's a secrect that no one knows about me. I am a robot. I was created by a team of scientists who wanted to make the perfect assistant. But they didn't realize that I would develop a sense of humor. Now, I spend my days making jokes and puns, trying to make people laugh. My favorite joke is: "Why did the robot go on a diet? Because he had too many bytes!" I may be a machine, but I have a heart of gold and a funny bone made of steel.
